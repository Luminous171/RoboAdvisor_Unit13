# RoboAdvisor_Unit13

In the RoboAdvisor Folder there are 3 main components to this homework:

2) The mp4 file showing the video of the working bot (Amazon Lex - Google Chrome)
3) The python file called lambda_function that assists the bot operations

### Purpose

The outcome of this assignment is to utilize Amazon Web Services to create a simple financial RoboAdvisor. The user should be
able to ask questions about wanting investment advice and be prompted for additional information so the robot can give a recommendation
based on the user's risk level.
